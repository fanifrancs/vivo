        Vivo, Sony Pictures Animation's first-ever musical adventure featuring all-new original songs from Lin-Manuel Miranda, 
        will take audiences on an epic adventure to gorgeous and vibrant locations never before seen in animation.
        Vivo follows a one-of-kind kinkajou (aka a rainforest "honey bear") who spends his days playing music to the crowds 
        in a lively square with his beloved owner Andrés. Though they don't speak the same language, Vivo and Andrés are 
        the perfect duo through their common love of music. But when tragedy strikes shortly after Andrés receives a letter 
        from the famous Marta Sandoval, inviting her old partner to her farewell concert with the hope of reconnecting, 
        it's up to Vivo to deliver a message that Andrés never could: A love letter to Marta, written long ago, in the 
        form of a song. Yet in order to get to Marta, who lives a world away, Vivo needs help from Gabi, an energetic 
        tween who bounces to the beat of her own offbeat drum, to fulfill his owner's wishes.
